## 1) Promotion Across Environments
**Question:**  
You have `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` environments. How would you automate moving a service from dev to staging, then on to prod, with proper checks along the way?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Multi-stage pipeline** with approvals or gating (manual or automated).
  - Same config, but different overrides for each environment (Helm or plain YAML).
  - Possibly a final manual step for production if your org requires it.
</details>

## 2) K8s Deployment Strategies (Rolling, Blue/Green, Canary)
**Question:**  
You want minimal downtime and easy rollback. Compare rolling updates, blue/green deployments, and canary releases.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Rolling**: Replaces pods one by one; simpler to set up but partial downtime if something goes wrong mid-roll.
  - **Blue/Green**: Parallel environments; easy rollback by flipping traffic back.
  - **Canary**: Gradual traffic shift, letting you observe performance in real time with a fraction of traffic.
</details>

## 3) Examples of Blue/Green & Canary
**Question (Scenario):**  
Your new microservice is critical, and you’re debating between blue/green and canary. Give a quick example of each strategy to show how you’d roll out a new version.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Blue/Green**:
    - Deploy new version in parallel (green).
    - Test it, switch traffic once stable.
    - Rollback by switching to old (blue) if needed.

  - **Canary**:
    - Send small % of traffic to new version.
    - Watch metrics, gradually increase if stable.
    - Roll back if problems arise.
</details>

## 4) Bonus: Canary/Blue-Green in Kubernetes
**Question:**  
Can you do canary or blue-green deployments directly in Kubernetes without extra tools?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Yes, but you have to handle traffic splits, labels, or separate services yourself.
  - Tools like **Argo Rollouts** or a service mesh (Istio) make it easier.
</details>

## 5) Argo Rollouts Explanation
**Question:**  
What is Argo Rollouts, and how does it help with advanced deployment strategies?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Kubernetes controller** that replaces Deployments with CRDs.
  - Supports canary, blue-green, progressive rollouts with health checks.
  - Integrates with ingress controllers or service meshes for traffic shaping.
</details>

## 6) Scenario: Slow Canary Deployments with Argo Rollouts
**Question:**  
You set up Argo Rollouts for canary deployments, but traffic shifting is slower than expected, delaying the rollout.

- What steps do you take to debug this behavior?
- How can you ensure canary traffic shifts happen faster?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Check the **Rollout object** for correct strategy, weights, and health checks.
  - Make sure the ingress or service mesh is applying traffic splits properly.
  - Validate that health checks or success criteria aren’t too strict, causing slow or paused progress.
  - Monitor logs or metrics to see if pods are failing readiness or not meeting thresholds.
