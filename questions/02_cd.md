## 1) Traditional Pipeline
**Question:**  
How would you handle a pipeline that promotes a service through dev → staging → production?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Use multi-stage pipelines with manual/auto approvals.
  - Helm or K8s manifests with environment-specific values.
  - Possibly environment branches or a parameter-driven approach.

## 2) Deployment Strategies in K8s
**Question:**  
Kubernetes has a default RollingUpdate strategy. Briefly explain how it works and how it differs from Blue/Green or Canary.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **RollingUpdate**: Replaces pods gradually, maintaining availability.
  - **Blue/Green**: Two environments, switch traffic from old (blue) to new (green).
  - **Canary**: Send a small fraction of traffic to new version before ramp-up.
