## 1) Promotion Across Environments
**Question:**  
You have `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` environments. How would you automate moving a service from dev to staging, then on to prod, with proper checks along the way?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Use a **multi-stage pipeline** with checks at each step.  
  - Keep the same config or Helm chart but override values for each environment.  
  - Possibly require a manual approval (or automated checks) before going to production.

## 2) K8s Deployment Strategies (Rolling, Blue/Green, Canary)
**Question:**  
You want minimal downtime and easy rollback. Compare rolling updates, blue/green deployments, and canary releases.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Rolling**: Replaces old pods with new pods one by one. Easy, but if something goes wrong, you may have partial downtime.  
  - **Blue/Green**: Keep two versions running (old = blue, new = green). Switch traffic once green is stable. Very fast rollback.  
  - **Canary**: Gradually shift a small percentage of traffic to the new version. Good for monitoring performance in real time.

## 3) Examples of Blue/Green & Canary
**Question (Scenario):**  
Your new microservice is critical, and you’re debating between blue/green and canary. Give a quick example of each strategy to show how you’d roll out a new version.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Blue/Green**:  
    1. Spin up the new version in parallel.  
    2. Test it without affecting current users.  
    3. Flip traffic over when ready, rollback is just flipping back.  

  - **Canary**:  
    1. Send maybe 5% of traffic to the new version.  
    2. Watch metrics or logs.  
    3. Increase to 50%, then 100% if all is good.  
    4. Roll back if something goes wrong.

## 4) Bonus: Canary/Blue-Green in Kubernetes
**Question:**  
Can you do canary or blue-green deployments directly in Kubernetes without extra tools?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Yes, but you’ll have to handle traffic splits yourself (labels, services, or an Ingress that routes traffic).  
  - Tools like **Argo Rollouts** or a service mesh make it easier.
</details>

## 5) Argo Rollouts Explanation
**Question:**  
What is Argo Rollouts, and how does it help with advanced deployment strategies?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - It’s a **Kubernetes controller** that replaces the standard Deployment object.  
  - Supports canary, blue-green, and other advanced patterns with CRDs.  
  - Integrates with ingress controllers or service meshes to manage traffic shifting.
