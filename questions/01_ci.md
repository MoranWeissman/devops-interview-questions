## 1) Clean Build Environments
**Question (Scenario):**  
Your builds sometimes fail because leftover files from previous runs cause unexpected results. How would you make sure each build runs in a clean, consistent environment?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Use **containerized** or **ephemeral** build agents so nothing carries over from one build to another.  
  - Each build starts fresh—no old dependencies messing things up.  
  - Helps ensure reproducibility and reliable test results.
</details>

## 2) Git & Branch Policies
**Question:**  
When setting up a new Git repository for a service, how do you make sure collaboration and merging are done in a controlled, high-quality way?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Require **pull requests** for merging into `main`, and set up branch protections.  
  - Have at least one reviewer approve changes, and run a quick test pipeline on the PR.  
  - Choose a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow, OneFlow, or trunk-based).
</details>

## 3) Testing from Dev/Personal Branches (Version Bump Avoidance)
**Question:**  
You want developers to build and test code on a personal branch without bumping the official app version. How do you do that?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Only bump the version if the build is running on `main` (after merging).  
  - Use temporary or **dev tags** (like `dev-<commit-hash>`) for personal branches.  
  - This lets people test changes without affecting the production version.
</details>

## 4) Code Validation in CI
**Question:**  
What kind of checks do you usually include in a CI pipeline to keep code quality high?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Linting** and **static analysis** for code style and possible security flaws.  
  - **Unit tests** to verify logic.  
  - Optional checks like integration tests, code coverage, or style checks.
</details>

## 5) Git Flow vs OneFlow
**Question:**  
Explain the main differences between Git Flow and OneFlow, and give an example of when you might pick one over the other.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Git Flow**:  
    - Has a `develop` branch and separate `release/` branches.  
    - Good for scheduled releases or big features that need isolation.  
  - **OneFlow**:  
    - Has fewer branches—features usually branch from and merge into `main`.  
    - Easier for continuous delivery or smaller teams who release often.
</details>

## 6) Unit / Integration / E2E Tests
**Question (Scenario):**  
A new developer asks how different types of tests fit into the CI pipeline. Can you explain the roles of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Unit tests**: Check individual pieces of code in isolation.  
  - **Integration tests**: Check how different parts of the system work together (e.g., a service talking to a database).  
  - **E2E tests**: Simulate actual user flows from start to finish in a real or near-real environment.
</details>

## 7) Scenario: Slow Build Times
**Question (Scenario):**  
The CI builds are getting slower and slower, which annoys developers. What could you do to speed things up?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Caching** dependencies so you don’t redownload or rebuild everything on each run.  
  - Order Dockerfile steps so that rarely changed steps are at the top.  
  - Split large builds into smaller steps or microservices.  
  - Use multi-stage Docker builds if you’re building containers.
