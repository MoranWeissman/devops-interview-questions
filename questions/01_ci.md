## 1) Clean Build Environments
**Question (Scenario):**  
Your builds sometimes fail because leftover files from previous runs cause unexpected results. How would you make sure each build runs in a clean, consistent environment?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Containerized** or **ephemeral** build agents ensure no leftover files or dependencies.
  - Reproducible environment: each run starts fresh.
  - Avoid “works on my machine” issues by isolating dependencies.
</details>

---

## 2) Git & Branch Policies
**Question:**  
When setting up a new Git repository for a service, how do you make sure collaboration and merging are done in a controlled, high-quality way?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Require **pull requests** to merge into `main`.
  - Use **branch protections**: code reviews, mandatory checks, or tests.
  - Adopt a branching strategy (Git Flow, OneFlow, or trunk-based).
</details>

---

## 3) Testing from Dev/Personal Branches (Version Bump Avoidance)
**Question:**  
You want developers to build and test code on a personal branch without bumping the official app version. How do you do that?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Only bump the version if building from `main` (after merging).
  - Use **ephemeral tags** (like `dev-<commit-hash>`) for personal branches.
  - This prevents cluttering your production semver with test builds.
</details>

---

## 4) Code Validation in CI
**Question:**  
What kind of checks do you usually include in a CI pipeline to keep code quality high?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Linting** and **static analysis** for code style and potential security flaws.
  - **Unit tests** to verify logic.
  - Optional checks: integration tests, code coverage, or style checks.
</details>

## 5) Git Flow vs OneFlow
**Question:**  
Explain the main differences between Git Flow and OneFlow, and give an example of when you might pick one over the other.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Git Flow**:
    - Has a `develop` branch and separate `release/` branches.
    - Good for scheduled releases or big features that need isolation.
  - **OneFlow**:
    - Fewer branches; merges features straight into `main`.
    - Easier for continuous delivery or smaller teams who release often.
</details>

---

## 6) Unit / Integration / E2E Tests
**Question (Scenario):**  
A new developer asks how different types of tests fit into the CI pipeline. Can you explain the roles of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Unit tests**: Check individual pieces of code in isolation.
  - **Integration tests**: Validate how services or components interact (e.g., API to DB).
  - **E2E tests**: Full user flow from start to finish, mirroring real production usage.
</details>

---

## 7) Scenario: Slow Build Times
**Question (Scenario):**  
The CI builds are getting slower and slower, which annoys developers. What could you do to speed things up?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Caching** dependencies so you don’t rebuild or re-download everything on each run.
  - Splitting large monolithic builds into smaller jobs or microservices.
  - Using multi-stage Docker builds or ephemeral agents to reduce overhead.
</details>

---

## 8) Scenario: Double-Build Problem in Docker CI Pipeline
**Question:**  
You notice your CI pipeline builds a Docker image twice—once for security scanning (e.g., Trivy) and again for deployment. This doubles build time and resource usage.

**How would you troubleshoot and resolve this?**

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Identify where each build step is triggered; check pipeline definitions or separate workflows.
  - Consolidate scanning and deployment into **one** pipeline stage, or reuse the built image artifact.
  - Push a single built image to a temporary registry, run scans on that image, then deploy if it’s clean.
</details>

## 9) Scenario: Docker Build Time Optimization in CI/CD
**Question (Scenario):**  
Your Docker builds in CI/CD are taking longer than expected, especially for a .NET or Java app with large dependencies.

**What can you do to improve the build time?**

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Optimize your **Dockerfile** structure: place static dependency installation steps at the top for caching.
  - Use **multi-stage builds** to keep final images small.
  - Possibly store a “build cache” or layer cache between runs so you don’t rebuild everything from scratch each time.
