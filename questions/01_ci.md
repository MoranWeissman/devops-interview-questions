# 01 – Continuous Integration (CI)

Here we focus on building code, versioning, branching, and ensuring each commit is validated properly.

## 1) Clean Build Environments
**Question:**  
How do you avoid “dirty” environments when running builds, ensuring a consistent CI process?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Containerized builds or ephemeral runners (Docker-in-Docker, ephemeral VMs).
  - Each build starts fresh with no leftover artifacts.
  - Helps ensure reproducibility.
</details>

---

## 2) Git & Branch Policies
**Question:**  
After creating a Git repository for a new service, what steps do you take to optimize collaboration and ensure best practices at the Git level?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Enforce branch policies on `main` (PR-based merges, required reviewers).
  - Introduce a validation pipeline (lint, tests, coverage).
  - Possibly adopt a branching model like Git Flow or OneFlow.
</details>

## 3) Testing Without Version Bumps
**Question:**  
How can developers test their code in the CI pipeline *without* incrementing the version whenever they do a personal or feature branch build?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Only bump version on merges to `main`.
  - Use ephemeral or branch-based tags (e.g., `dev-<commit-hash>`).
  - Allows QA to test interim builds without messing production versioning.
</details>

## 4) Double Builds in CI
**Question:**  
Sometimes we build a Docker image twice (once for security scans, once for the main pipeline). How might we avoid that duplication?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Consolidate steps into a single pipeline with multiple jobs that reuse build artifacts.
  - Conditionals in the pipeline if PR vs. main event.
  - Store the built image in a temporary registry or cache for scanning.
</details>

## 5) Git Flow vs OneFlow
**Question:**  
Explain the main differences between Git Flow and OneFlow, and when you might prefer each.

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Git Flow**: Separate `develop` branch, feature branches, release branches; suitable for stable, scheduled releases.
  - **OneFlow**: Simplified, fewer branches, merges features directly into `master` or a single main branch; suits continuous delivery.
</details>

---

## 6) Unit / Integration / E2E Tests
**Question:**  
What are unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests, and how do they differ?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Unit**: Tests small pieces of logic in isolation.
  - **Integration**: Tests how components interact together.
  - **E2E**: Simulates real user flows from start to finish in a production-like environment.
</details>

---

## 7) Code Validation in CI
**Question:**  
Which validation steps can be included in a CI pipeline for code quality?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - Linting, static analysis (SAST), style checks.
  - Unit tests, code coverage.
  - Possibly security scanning or license checks.
</details>
