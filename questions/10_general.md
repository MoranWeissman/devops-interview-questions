# 10 – General / Architecture

For broader conceptual or cross-topic questions, including architecture patterns.

## 1) Stateless vs Stateful
**Question:**  
Explain the difference between stateless and stateful applications. Why does it matter for scaling or resilience?

<details>
  <summary>Hints / Key Points</summary>

  - **Stateless**: no session data persisted in-memory between requests → easier to scale, more resilient.
  - **Stateful**: maintains session/data in memory, can be more complex (requires persistent storage, specialized scaling).
